Image keys for Java PC-1 problems

Head over to http://java.kgisl.com and practice Java online on CloudCoder.  
If you want to share some of your solutions as image keys, upload them on this repo
through Github. 
And do a "Pull Request" after you have added to your private repo. 
That way it will role into the main repo automatically.
